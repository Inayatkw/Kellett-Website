  <p class="text-muted" >Kellett School was founded in 1976 as a not-for-profit association by 
    like-minded parents, in order to provide a high-quality British education to the English-speaking
     community in Hong Kong.

    Today, Kellett, the British International School in Hong Kong, educates over 1400 students from 4 
    to 18 years in the English National Curriculum, offering a truly outstanding education, evidenced 
    by a BSO Inspection (2023), membership of HMC and IAPS, as well as exceptional public examination 
    results.
    
    A broad curriculum, coupled with a wide variety of extra-curricular activities, ensures that all
     students from Reception through to I/GCSEs and A-levels achieve their personal best.

   campus in Kowloon Bay offers a two-form Preparatory School and has a rich history as "The British International School in Hong Kong," established in 1976 to provide an 
   exceptional education to the English-speaking community in Hong Kong, comparable to renowned independent schools in the UK.</p>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Kellett is proud to have an almost 50 year history in Hong Kong and places huge importance on fostering connections
   with our wider community and giving back to society. We partner with a wide range of charities and institutions in Hong Kong. 
  Significant emphasis is placed on the importance of service to others in our wider community. In the Senior School, all students participate in a week-long excursion overseas where 
  community service is a major component. There are also year-long opportunities to do community service as an after school activity with our long-standing charity partners. Meanwhile, 
   our Prep schools have long-standing ties with sister-schools in Hong Kong with whom they undertake language exchanges.  
  The School believes providing bursaries to those who would benefit from a Kellett education but are unable to afford the fees not only provides opportunity to those individuals but 
  also benefits our whole school community.In the Senior School, the students in each House select which charity to support and how they are going to raise funds. The charities are related 
  to the Sustainable Development Goals. In both Prep Schools, money is raised through pizza sales, bake sales, and other Parents Committee led activities, as well as the sales of a range of
   Kellett Cares items, such as umbrellas, aprons and Pre-Loved uniform.
